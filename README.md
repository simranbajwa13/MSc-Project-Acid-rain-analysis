# MSc-Project-Acid-rain-analysis
Acid rain has been pne of the main hazard to the ecological system. It is a result of  sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX)  emitted into the atmosphere and transported by wind and air currents. The SO2 and NOX react with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form sulfuric and nitric acids.  These then mix with water and other materials before falling to the ground. Coal combustion has always been one of the main contributors to sulphur dioxide emission in the environment. 
This study aims towards forecasting, future trends of acid rain emisson in UK based on the past values of it in the time series. 
Along with predicting the future trends, it is necessary to analysis the correlation between various factors responsible for acid rain emission. The study, performs a correlation analysis to test the correlation between so2 emission, which is considered as a prominent source of acid rain and annual coal production in UK since 1990. Besides this the influence of so2 emisson on acid rain and coal production on so2 is forecasted using a multivariate time series model.
